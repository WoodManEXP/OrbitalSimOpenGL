Runtime changes
 - Change the constant (done)
 - Remove body(ies) (done)
 - Change mass of body(ies) (done)
 - Extra bodies 

SimModel

 Render
 
	Perform animation calculations
	Set camera characteristics
	Draw axis
	SimBodyList.Render()	// Send aspect ratio


SimBodyList

 Constructor 
	make SharedSphere
	
 Render
	Load SharedSphere
	Loop over each body (aspect ratio)
	
	
SimBody

 Render (aspect ratio)
	updating parameters to vertex shader
		also counting for aspect ratio
	Draw


- Mars moons draw strangely/flicker and Pluto (done)
- Control windows not so "on-top" (done)
- GoNear draws strangely when sim running (Done)
	- Reimplement GoNear deceleration phase (maybe later, not so great with bodies in motion)
- Add point-at and ID (hit testing)
- Keep looking at (done)
- Stay near (done)
- Does hours iteration work? (done)
- Axis on/off (done)
- Wireframe on/off (done)
- Reticle on/off (done)
- Implement PathTrace (done)
	Each body selected individually (done)
	Keep only last N trace points (done)
- Barycenter (center of mass) not adjusting. Either cause it to adjust or remove it as target in bodies selections
- Implement generic command entry point in OrbitalSimCmds (done)
- Reticle as X or + or somesuch
- Orbit about work with moving bodies (done)
- More efficiently update VP_Matrix4d in SimCamera:UpdateViewMatrix (rather than doing "new") (done)
- Suspend frame redraw if nothing happening
- Don't redraw on every frame. Draw at 30fps rate?
- Move Axis from SimModel to a separate class (done)
	Draw as GL_LINES rather than triangles (done)
- Collision detection
	See CollisionDetection class
	remove smaller body from list & update MassMass, loss for heat generation, 10%
	Inelastic - add smaller body's mass xfers to larger, retain larger's color
	change name to larger-smaller
	add vel/mass vectors, change vectors on retained body to match
	Color Red and larger for a while after collision
	Sumultaneous > 2 body collision?
	Add closest approach, so far, indicator to SimWindows status area (done)
	Produce a visual signal of collision, explosion
	Collision not disable trace for remaining body (done)
	Trace setting not preserved in Body Mods list after collision
- Reset sim button/capability (done)
- Get JPJ body color from Bodies file (done_)
- Move body color into the .csv and .json files (done)
- Three body example
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem
- Mass change range from 1/100 to 100X ? Maybe 200x
- LookAt sets body tracked in status area (done)
- Stats show body dist from Origin (done)
- Reset sets back to Start button enabled (original state)
- Closest approach can be more than 2 bodies simultaneously
- Check ephemeris values for Mars moons Demios and Phobos
- Reset change body names back to original values (noticable after collision when body names changed) (done)
- Trace on renamed body throws exception (done)
- Barycenter after collision calcs wrong (done)
- Use travel vectors to determione closest approach (done)
  The shortest distance between two lines is the length of projection of any vector between the two lines onto the cross product of the direction of the two lines. –

- Stats showing for removed Body
- 

Examples
- Stable system
	- In a plane
	- Pluto slighty out of plane
- How does does the Sun move (mostly influence of Jupiter)
- What if Sun
	- Got more massive
	- Went away
		- See Moon stays with Earth
- Massive body approaches perpendicular to the plane
- Primordial BH approaches system (like in Three Body Problem)
- Grav constant changes (with Star Trek Q clip)
- Only Sun and Jupier in system
- What if Jupiter
	- Went away
	- Got more massive
- What happens to moon if Earth goes away

Runtime changes
 - Change the constant (done)
 - Remove body(ies) (done)
 - Change mass of body(ies) (done)
 - Extra bodies 

SimModel

 Render
 
	Perform animation calculations
	Set camera characteristics
	Draw axis
	SimBodyList.Render()	// Send aspect ratio


SimBodyList

 Constructor 
	make SharedSphere
	
 Render
	Load SharedSphere
	Loop over each body (aspect ratio)
	
	
SimBody

 Render (aspect ratio)
	updating parameters to vertex shader
		also counting for aspect ratio
	Draw


- Mars moons draw strangely/flicker and Pluto (done)
- Control windows not so "on-top" (done)
- GoNear draws strangely when sim running (Done)
	- Reimplement GoNear deceleration phase (maybe later, not so great with bodies in motion)
- Add point-at and ID (hit testing)
- Keep looking at (done)
- Stay near (done)
- Does hours iteration work? (done)
- Axis on/off (done)
- Wireframe on/off (done)
- Reticle on/off (done)
- Implement Trace
	Each body selected individually (done)
	Keep only last N trace points
- Barycenter (center of mass) not adjusting. Either cause it to adjust or remove it as target in bodies selections
- Implement generic command entry point in OrbitalSimCmds (done)
- Reticle as X or + or somesuch
- Orbit about work with moving bodies (done)
- More efficiently update VP_Matrix4d in SimCamera:UpdateViewMatrix (rather than doing "new") (done)
- Suspend frame redraw if nothing happening
- Move Axis from SimModel to a separate class
- Collision detection
	See CollisionDetection class
	remove smaller body from list & update MassMass
	add smaller body's mass to larger, retain larger's color
	change name to larger-smaller
	add vel/mass vectors, change vectors on retained body to match
	Color Red nd larger for a while after collision
	Sumultaneous > 2 body collision?
	Add closest approach, so far, indicator to SimWindows status area (done)
- Reset sim button/capability (done)
- Get JPJ body color from Bodies file
